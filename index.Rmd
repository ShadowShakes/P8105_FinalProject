Hi! This is the final project of P8105 Data Science, and welcome to explore this project.


### Introduction

During this semester we have received many local safety alerts from campus safety department and apps like "Citizen". Last month, a shooting case happened on the Broadway very close to our campus. This further raised our team's strong intention to conduct exploration and analysis of CUMC local and New York City's safety problems.

In this project, we will first conduct data cleaning, exploratory data analytics so as to better understand the distribution and features of NYC criminal complaint. Next, we will research if the Covid-19 pandemic did have an impact on the crime reports'  distribution in NYC. In the end, we will implement an interactive map to help visualize the criminal complaints distribution and summraize our final conclusions.

Clean and tidy the dataset, retain useful variables and deal with nulls and outliers.

* Data visualization analysis  
Conduct visual analysis based on a series of data visualization plots.

* Statistical modelling analysis  
Build statistical models to give prediction and interpretation of the modelling.

* Statistical testing analysis  
Statistical testings and give analysis.

* Interactive map  
Implementation of an interactive map.

* Conclusions and report
