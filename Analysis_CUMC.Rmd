In this section we briefly analyze the crime complaints that happen near CUMC campus.

We define The following region as the CUMC campus where most of us would go out for daily studying, eating and shopping.

complaint =
  tibble(
    files = list.files("./Data/"),
    path = str_c("./Data/", files)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  select(-files, -path, -cmplnt_num, -ky_cd, -atpt_cptd, -jurisdiction) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = strftime(as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"),"%a")) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[month],
    hour = substr(time, start = 1, stop = 2),
    minute = substr(time, start = 4, stop = 5),
    hour = ifelse(hour == "00" & minute == "01", NA, hour),
    wkend_wkday = ifelse(day_of_week %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "weekend", "weekday"),

      (as.integer(hour) > 14) & (as.integer(hour) <= 22) ~ 2
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(-time, -minute) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.factor(year),
    month = factor(month, levels = month.abb),
    day_of_week = factor(day_of_week, levels = c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")),

    )
```



```{r}
num_days = function(month, year) {
  
  year = as.integer(year)
  months = 1:12
  names(months) = month.abb
  month = months[month]
  
  as.numeric(strftime(as.Date(paste(year + month %/% 12, month %% 12 + 1, "01", sep = "-")) - 1, "%d"))
  
}

complaint %>%
  filter(level == "FELONY") %>% 
  mutate(month = match(month, month.abb)) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(mean_freq = n() / num_days(month, year)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~list(year, month), y = ~mean_freq, color = "orange",
    type = "bar"
  ) %>% 
  colorbar(x = 1, y = 1) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Average Daily Felony Frequency by Year and Month around CUMC",
    xaxis = list(title = "Year & Month", titlefont = list(size = 1)),
    yaxis = list(title = "Felony Frequency")
  )
```

According to this plot, we find that the daily felony frequency trend around CUMC has strong fluctuation between different months, seasons and years. But there does not seem to have obvious common patterns in each year.  
There is a peak appears from the autumn 2020 to the spring of 2021. Based on the Covid-10 pandemic period, we think that it may have some connection with the end of city lockdown and economic downturn caused by Covid. 


### Suspect Race Analysis
```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_race) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_race, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Race and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Race"
  )

complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_race) %>% 
  group_by(level, susp_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_race, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = susp_race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Race and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Race"
  )
```
Based on the plot, the suspect race around CUMC is mostly Black, White Hispanic, Black Hispanic. This is probably because there are more Black, White Hispanic, Black Hispanic people living in Washington Height around CUMC than other regions.

The distribution of suspect races committing crime between years have some differences, but it becomes more stable after Covid-19 from 2020 to 2022.

And for crime levels, there are larger proportion of White Hispanic and Black Hispanic people committing Felony level crimes, while suspects from other races have larger proportion of committing Misdemeanor and Violation crimes.

### Suspect Age Group Analysis
```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_age_group) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_age_group, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Age Group and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Age Group"
  )

complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_age_group) %>% 
  group_by(level, susp_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_age_group, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = susp_age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Age Group and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Age Group"
  )
```

According to this plot, the most frequency suspect age group is from 25 to 64. And there are more suspects in 45-64 age group that commit violation crime.

### Victim Sex Analysis
```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, vic_sex) %>% 
  group_by(year, vic_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(vic_sex, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = vic_sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Sex and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Sex"
  )

complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, vic_sex) %>% 
  group_by(level, vic_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(vic_sex, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = vic_sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Sex and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Sex"
  )
```

There is equal proportion of victim sex to be Female or Male, both around 0.5.  
But on different levels, the victim sex has large difference. There are significantly more Male victims on Felony crimes, more Male victims on Misdemeanor crimes, and significantly more Female victims on Violation crimes. We infer that the violations like the sexual harassment happens more on Female victims which may partly explain for this difference.


### Victim Race Analysis
```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, vic_race) %>% 
  group_by(year, vic_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(vic_race, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = vic_race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Race and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Race"
  )

complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, vic_race) %>% 
  group_by(level, vic_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(vic_race, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = vic_race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Race and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Race"
  )
```

According to the plot, victims from White Hispanic are the most frequent, and Black Hispanic victims are the second most frequent, then the Black and Black Hispanic. This trends are similar to suspects' race distribution.   
Also, we observe that fewer Black victims in Felony crimes and more Black Hispanic and White Hispanic crimes.
