In this section we would like to explore more about the crime suspect's features.  
We mainly focus on studying the "Felony Crimes", which includes:  
"BURGLARY", "FELONY ASSAULT", "GRAND LARCENY", "GRAND LARCENY OF MOTOR VEHICLE", "MURDER & NON-NEGL. MANSLAUGHTER", "RAPE", "ROBBERY" in `offense` column based on the common definition and reference.  

## Visual Analysis
We will first use data visualization to give an overview of the distribution of suspect's features.

```{r read&tidy, include = FALSE}
setwd(dir = "./Data")
a <- list.files()     

dir <- paste("./",a,sep="")                 
n <- length(dir) 
merge_data <- read.csv(file = dir[1],header=T,sep=",")   
merge_data <- cbind(dir[1], merge_data )
merge_data <- rename(merge_data, c("dir[1]"="yyyymm"))
for (i in 2:7){
  new.data <- read.csv(file = dir[i], header=T, sep=",")
  new.data <- cbind(dir[i], new.data)
  new.data <- rename(new.data, c("dir[i]"="yyyymm"))
  merge_data <- rbind(merge_data,new.data)
}
complaint=merge_data%>% 
  select(-cmplnt_num, -ky_cd, -atpt_cptd, -jurisdiction) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = strftime(as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"),"%a")) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[month],
    hour = substr(time, start = 1, stop = 2),
    minute = substr(time, start = 4, stop = 5),
    hour = ifelse(hour == "00" & minute == "01", NA, hour),

    time_range = case_when(
      (as.integer(hour) > 22) | (as.integer(hour) <= 6) ~ 0,
      (as.integer(hour) > 6) & (as.integer(hour) <= 14) ~ 1,
      (as.integer(hour) > 14) & (as.integer(hour) <= 22) ~ 2
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(-day, -time, -minute) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.factor(year),
    month = factor(month, levels = month.abb),
    day_of_week = factor(day_of_week, levels = c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")),

  )
```


### Suspect Sex Analysis

```{r plot_suspect_sex}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_sex) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_sex, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Sex and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Sex"
  )
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_sex) %>% 
  group_by(level, susp_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_sex, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = susp_sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Sex and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Sex"
  )
```

According to the plot, most of the suspect's sex(if recorded) is male, female suspects appear to be much fewer than male suspect.  
And in 2020, the propotions of male suspect are even larger than other years. In the three kinds of crime level, male aslo has larger proportion than female.

### Suspect Race Analysis

```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_race) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_race, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Race and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Race"
  )
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_race) %>% 
  group_by(level, susp_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_race, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = susp_race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Race and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Race"
  )
```

Based on barplot, we can see that the most frequent suspect races are: Black, White Hispanic and White, while Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaskan Native are the least freqeut races to be a suspect. In the three kinds of crime level, black and white hispanic also take the largest proportion.

### Suspect Age Group Analysis
 
```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_age_group) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_age_group, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Age Group and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Age Group"
  )
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_age_group) %>% 
  group_by(level, susp_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_age_group, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = susp_age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Age Group and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Age Group"
  )
```

According to the barplot, we can see that the age group between 25 and 44 years old takes up largest proportion in suspects, and the next is 18-24 years old.  
Besides, with time going by, the proportion of age group between 25-64 years old are rising in suspects' age distribution.


## Statistical Testing Analysis
We use statistical tests to find if there is a difference in daily crime records of suspects from difference races like Asian/Pacific Islander and White.

$H_0$:The average number of daily crimes recorded by NYPD is equal for Asian/Pacific suspect and White suspect.

$H_1$: The average number of daily crimes recorded by NYPD is not equal for Asian/Pacific suspect and White suspect. 

### Suspect Race Analysis
```{r}
crimebyday_aspa = complaint %>% 
  group_by(year,month,day_of_week, susp_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_bydate = n(),
  ) %>% 
  unique()

crimebyday_white = complaint %>% 
  group_by(year,month,day_of_week) %>% 
  filter(susp_race == "WHITE") %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_bydate = n(),
  ) %>% 
  unique()

t.test(crimebyday_aspa$n_bydate,crimebyday_white$n_bydate) %>% broom::tidy()
```

According to the test results, since the p-value is very small, we reject $H_0$ and conclude that there's a significant difference on daily crime numbers between those two suspect races.


## Regression Modelling Analysis

In many circumstances, the NYPD is unclear about the suspect's features, thus make it more difficult to find the suspect. 
Here we are interested in how suspect's Sex and Race are related to other factors in the dataset, and if we can predict the suspect's feature based on other information.  
We build classification models to give prediction of the criminal's features based on other factors, and draw conclusions from the coefficients of the factors. 

### Suspect Sex Prediction

```{r}
tidydata1 = complaint %>%
  select(-day_of_week) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(susp_sex = ifelse(susp_sex == "M", 1, 0),
         vic_sex = ifelse(vic_sex == "M", 1, 0), 
         jurisdiction_code = as.numeric(jurisdiction_code)) %>%
  mutate(
    jurisdiction_code = ifelse(jurisdiction_code >= 3, 3, jurisdiction_code)) %>%
  mutate(jurisdiction_code = as.factor(jurisdiction_code))
```

The logistic regression model to predict the suspect's sex based on other factors.
```{r}
mylogit <- glm(susp_sex ~ 
                borough + jurisdiction_code 
               + level + susp_age_group + susp_race + vic_age_group
               + vic_race + vic_sex, data = tidydata1, family = "binomial")

mylogit %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value)
```

Based on the coefficient output, we find that:

For backward stepwise, in order to select variables.

```{r}
step(mylogit, direction = 'backward')
```

Through backward, we found that we need most of the variables in previous model since the coefficients are significant.

We see the output performance of the model.
```{r}
tidydata1 %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(mylogit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = susp_age_group, y = resid)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = susp_age_group))
```

According to the plot

### Suspect Race Prediction

And we also want to take a lot at the race prediction.
```{r}
tidy_data2 = tidydata1 %>%
  filter(susp_race %in% c("BLACK","ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER")) %>%
  mutate(susp_race = ifelse(susp_race == "BLACK",1,0))

mylogit_2 = glm(susp_race ~  borough + jurisdiction_code
+ level + susp_age_group
+ susp_sex + vic_age_group + vic_race + vic_sex, data = tidy_data2, family = "binomial")

# almost full model except victim information
mylogit_2 %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value)
```

The output performance of the model.
```{r}
tidy_data2 %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(mylogit_2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = resid)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = level))
```
