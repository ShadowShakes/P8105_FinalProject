In this section we would like to explore more about the crime suspect's features. We mainly focus on studying the "Felony Crimes", which includes:  
"BURGLARY", "FELONY ASSAULT", "GRAND LARCENY", "GRAND LARCENY OF MOTOR VEHICLE", "MURDER & NON-NEGL. MANSLAUGHTER", "RAPE", "ROBBERY" in `offense` column

## Visual Analysis
We will first use data visualization to give an overview of the distribution of suspect's features.

```{r read&tidy, include = FALSE}
setwd(dir = "./Data")
a <- list.files()     

dir <- paste("./",a,sep="")                 
n <- length(dir) 
merge_data <- read.csv(file = dir[1],header=T,sep=",")   
merge_data <- cbind(dir[1], merge_data )
merge_data <- rename(merge_data, c("dir[1]"="yyyymm"))
for (i in 2:7){
  new.data <- read.csv(file = dir[i], header=T, sep=",")
  new.data <- cbind(dir[i], new.data)
  new.data <- rename(new.data, c("dir[i]"="yyyymm"))
  merge_data <- rbind(merge_data,new.data)
}
complaint=merge_data%>% 
  select(-cmplnt_num, -ky_cd, -atpt_cptd, -jurisdiction) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = strftime(as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"),"%a")) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[month],
    hour = substr(time, start = 1, stop = 2),
    minute = substr(time, start = 4, stop = 5),
    hour = ifelse(hour == "00" & minute == "01", NA, hour),
    wkend_wkday = ifelse(day_of_week %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "weekend", "weekday"),
    borough = ifelse(borough == "(null)", NA, borough),
    offense = ifelse(offense == "(null)", NA, offense),
    susp_sex = ifelse(susp_sex %in% c("M", "F"), susp_sex, NA),
    susp_age_group = ifelse(susp_age_group %in% c("<18", "18-24", "25-44", "45-64", "65+"), susp_age_group, NA),

    vic_age_group = ifelse(vic_age_group %in% c("<18", "18-24", "25-44", "45-64", "65+"), vic_age_group, NA),
    vic_race = ifelse(vic_race %in% c("UNKNOWN", "(null)"), NA, vic_race),
    jurisdiction_code = as.numeric(jurisdiction_code),
    jurisdiction_code = ifelse(jurisdiction_code >= 3, 3, jurisdiction_code),
    covid_state = ifelse(year >= 2020, 1, 0),
    time_range = case_when(
      (as.integer(hour) > 22) | (as.integer(hour) <= 6) ~ 0,
      (as.integer(hour) > 6) & (as.integer(hour) <= 14) ~ 1,
      (as.integer(hour) > 14) & (as.integer(hour) <= 22) ~ 2
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(-day, -time, -minute) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.factor(year),
    month = factor(month, levels = month.abb),
    day_of_week = factor(day_of_week, levels = c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")),
    hour = factor(hour),
    precinct = as.factor(precinct),
    borough = as.factor(borough),
    level = as.factor(level),
    offense = as.factor(offense),
    susp_sex = as.factor(susp_sex),
    susp_age_group = as.factor(susp_age_group),
    susp_race = as.factor(susp_race),
    vic_sex = as.factor(vic_sex),
    vic_age_group = as.factor(vic_age_group),
    vic_race = as.factor(vic_race),
    wkend_wkday = as.factor(wkend_wkday),
covid_state = as.factor(covid_state),
time_range = as.factor(time_range),
jurisdiction_code=as.factor(jurisdiction_code)
  )
```


### Suspect Sex

```{r plot_suspect_sex}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_sex) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_sex, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Sex and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Sex"
  )
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_sex) %>% 
  group_by(level, susp_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_sex, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = susp_sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Sex and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Sex"
  )
```
According to the plot, most of the suspect's sex(if recorded) is male, female suspects appear to be much fewer than male suspect.  
And in 2020, the propotions of male suspect are even larger than other years. In the three kinds of crime level, male aslo has larger proportion than female.

### Suspect Race

```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_race) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_race, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Race and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Race"
  )
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_race) %>% 
  group_by(level, susp_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_race, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = susp_race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Race and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Race"
  )
```
Based on barplot, we can see that the most frequent suspect races are: Black, White Hispanic and White, while Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaskan Native are the least freqeut races to be a suspect. In the three kinds of crime level, black and white hispanic also take the largest proportion.

### Suspect Age Group

```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_age_group) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_age_group, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Age Group and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Age Group"
  )
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_age_group) %>% 
  group_by(level, susp_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(level) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_age_group, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = percentage, fill = susp_age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Level",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Suspect Age Group and Level",
    fill = "Suspect Age Group"
  )
```
According to the barplot, we can see that the age group between 25 and 44 years old takes up largest proportion in suspects, and the next is 18-24 years old.  
Besides, with time going by, the proportion of age group between 25-64 years old are rising in suspects' age distribution.


## Statistical Testing
We use statistical tests to find if there is a difference in daily crime records of suspects from difference races.

### Suspect Race
```{r}
crimebyday_aspa = complaint %>% 
  group_by(year,month,day_of_week) %>% 
  filter(susp_race == "ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER") %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_bydate = n(),
  ) %>% 
  unique()

crimebyday_white = complaint %>% 
  group_by(year,month,day_of_week) %>% 
  filter(susp_race == "WHITE") %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_bydate = n(),
  ) %>% 
  unique()

t.test(crimebyday_aspa$n_bydate,crimebyday_white$n_bydate)%>% broom::tidy()
```

According to the test results, we can find that there's a significant difference between the suspect races.


## Regression Modelling Analysis
We try to build models to give prediction of the criminal's features based on other factors, and see if we can draw conclusions from the coefficients of the factors.

### Suspect Sex

```{r}
tidydata1 = complaint %>%
  select(-day_of_week) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(susp_sex = ifelse(susp_sex == "M",1,0),vic_sex = ifelse(vic_sex == "M",1,0),jurisdiction_code = as.numeric(jurisdiction_code)) %>%
  mutate(
    jurisdiction_code = ifelse(jurisdiction_code >= 3, 3, jurisdiction_code)) %>%
  mutate(jurisdiction_code=as.factor(jurisdiction_code))

```

We build a logistic regression model to predict the suspect's sex based on other factors.
```{r}
mylogit <- glm(susp_sex ~ 
                borough + jurisdiction_code 
               +level+susp_age_group +susp_race+vic_age_group
               +vic_race+vic_sex+covid_state, data = tidydata1, family = "binomial")

mylogit %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value)
```

For backward stepwise, in order to select variables.

```{r}
step(mylogit, direction = 'backward')
```

Through backward, we found that we need all the variables.

We see the output of the model.
```{r}
tidydata1 %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(mylogit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = susp_age_group, y = resid)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = susp_age_group)) + facet_wrap(~covid_state)
```

### Suspect Race

```{r}
tidy_data2 = tidydata1%>%
  filter(susp_race %in% c("BLACK","ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER"))%>%
  mutate(susp_race=ifelse(susp_race == "BLACK",1,0))
mylogit_2 = glm(susp_race ~  borough + jurisdiction_code
+level+susp_age_group
+susp_sex+vic_age_group+vic_race+vic_sex+covid_state, data = tidy_data2, family = "binomial")
# almost full model except victor information
mylogit_2 %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value)
```

```{r}
tidy_data2 %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(mylogit_2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = resid)) + geom_violin(aes(fill = level)) + facet_wrap(~covid_state)
```
