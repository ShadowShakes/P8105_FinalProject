Our dataset does not contain data for October, November and December of the year 2022. We are interested in the following main felonies: Burglary, Felony Assault, Grand Larceny, Grand Larceny of Motor Vehicle, Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter, Rape, and Robbery.

## Daily crimes on different dangerous level
```{r}
dangrous_data=complaint %>% 
  select(-day_of_week) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(vic_race)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(level)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(vic_age_group)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(vic_sex))
  

dangrous_data = dangrous_data%>% 
  mutate(
   level_lm = case_when(
     level == 'VIOLATION' ~ 0,
     level == "MISDEMEANOR" ~ 1,
     level == "FELONY" ~ 2
   )
  )
```

From the data and online research, we can easily find that violation represents the lowest level, followed by misdemeanors and felonies. Therefore, they are assigned 0, 1, and 2 to represent the degree of danger of the event, that is, the risk factor faced by the victim.

## Relationship between victim characteristics and crime level

### Victim Gender Analysis

### Number of incidents on different gender
```{r}
plot_his_sex = dangrous_data %>% 
  group_by(level,vic_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs= n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = level,y = n_obs,fill = vic_sex)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(
    title = "relationship between dangerous and victim sex",
    x = "dangerous level",
    y = "number of cases"
  )
plot_his_sex
```

Through the stacked bar chart, we can see that when the danger level is violation (0), the number of incidents where the victim is a woman is much higher than that of a man. At intermediate and higher levels, no significant differences can be observed by observation,

```{r fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 9}
plot_pie_sex0 = dangrous_data %>%
  group_by(level,vic_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  filter(type == 0)

plot_pie_sex0=plot_ly(plot_pie_sex0,labels =~ vic_sex,values= ~n_obs) %>% 
  add_pie %>% 
  layout(title = "VIOLATION for vic_sex")

plot_pie_sex1 = dangrous_data %>%
  group_by(level,vic_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  filter(type == 1)

plot_pie_sex1 = plot_ly(plot_pie_sex1,labels = ~ vic_sex,values = ~n_obs) %>% 
  add_pie %>% 
  layout(title = "MISDEMEANOR for vic_sex")

plot_pie_sex2 = dangrous_data %>%
  group_by(level,vic_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  filter(type == 2)

plot_pie_sex2 = plot_ly(plot_pie_sex2,labels = ~ vic_sex,values = ~n_obs) %>% 
  add_pie %>% 
  layout(title = "FELONY for vic_sex")

par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot_pie_sex0
plot_pie_sex1
plot_pie_sex2
```

### Prediction of crime level based on logistic regression

In order to simplify the model and facilitate effective verification, we classify felony and misdemeanors with no obvious difference into one category - high risk, regard violation as low risk, and assign ordinal variables 1, 0 respectively.
```{r}
#manipulate a logistic regression about level~vic

dangrous_data = dangrous_data %>% 
  mutate(
   level_lm = case_when(
     level == 'VIOLATION' ~ 0,
     level == "MISDEMEANOR" ~ 0,
     level == "FELONY" ~ 1
   )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    level_lm = ordered(level_lm, labels = c('0', '1'))
    )

model_virsex <- glm(level_lm ~ vic_sex ,family = binomial, data = dangrous_data)
summary(model_virsex)
```

By observing the results, the regression coefficient of the independent variable is positive, and the significance level is less than 0.05. It is not difficult to see that the gender difference has a significant significance for judging the event level. That is, women are more likely to be persecuted in VIOLATION-level events.
In the event types with higher risk levels, the probability of men and women being in danger will tend to be equal.

### Relationship between victim's age group and crime level

```{r}
dangrous_data = dangrous_data %>% 
  mutate(
   level_lm = case_when(
     level == 'VIOLATION' ~ 0,
     level == "MISDEMEANOR" ~ 1,
     level == "FELONY" ~ 2
   )
  )

plot_bar_agegroup = dangrous_data %>% 
  group_by(level,vic_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = level,y = n_obs,fill = vic_age_group)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "relationship between dangerous level and victim age range",
    x = "dangerous level",
    y = "number of cases"
  )

plot_bar_agegroup

plot_pie_age0 = dangrous_data %>%
  group_by(level,vic_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  filter(type == 0)

plot_pie_age0 = plot_ly(data = plot_pie_age0, x = ~vic_age_group,y = ~n_obs, type = "bar", color = ~vic_age_group) %>% 
  layout(title = "VIOLATION for vic_age")

plot_pie_age1 = dangrous_data %>%
  group_by(level,vic_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  filter(type == 1)

plot_pie_age1 = plot_ly(data = plot_pie_age1, x = ~vic_age_group,y = ~n_obs, type = "bar", color = ~vic_age_group) %>% 
  layout(title = "MISDEMEANOR for vic_age")

plot_pie_age2 = dangrous_data %>%
  group_by(level,vic_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  filter(type == 2)

plot_pie_age2 = plot_ly(data = plot_pie_age2, x = ~vic_age_group,y = ~n_obs, type = "bar", color = ~vic_age_group) %>% 
  layout(title = "FELONY for vic_age")

plot_pie_age0
plot_pie_age1
plot_pie_age2

dangrous_data = dangrous_data %>% 
  mutate(
   level_lm = case_when(
     level == 'VIOLATION' ~ 0,
     level == "MISDEMEANOR" ~ 0,
     level == "FELONY" ~ 1
   )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    level_lm = ordered(level_lm, labels = c('0', '1'))
    )
model_viage <- glm(level_lm ~ vic_age_group ,family = binomial, data = dangrous_data)

summary(model_viage)
```
The results show that although the victim group is mainly targeted at 25-44. With the level of dangerous increase, the 45-64 victim age group dropped about 4 percentage points and the 18-24 victim age group rose about 3 points.
From the logistics regression, `vic_age_group` is useful for predicting the level of dangerous.

### Victim's race and crime level
```{r}
dangrous_data = dangrous_data %>% 
  mutate(
   level_lm = case_when(
     level == 'VIOLATION' ~ 0,
     level == "MISDEMEANOR" ~ 1,
     level == "FELONY" ~ 2
   )
  )

dnd = dangrous_data %>% 
  group_by(level,vic_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = level,y = n_obs,fill = vic_race)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  labs(
    title = "relationship between dangerous and victim race",
    x = "dangerous level",
    y = "number of cases"
  )

plot_his_race = dangrous_data %>% 
  group_by(level,vic_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = level,y = n_obs,fill=vic_race)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
plot_his_race

plot_pie_race0=dangrous_data %>%
  group_by(level,vic_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  filter(type == 0)

plot_pie_race0 = plot_ly(data = plot_pie_race0, x = ~ vic_race, y= ~n_obs, type = "bar", color = ~vic_race) %>% 
  layout(title = "VIOLATION for vic_race")

plot_pie_race1 = dangrous_data %>%
  group_by(level,vic_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  filter(type == 1)

plot_pie_race1 = plot_ly(data = plot_pie_race1, x = ~ vic_race, y= ~n_obs, type = "bar", color = ~vic_race) %>% 
  layout(title = "MISDEMEANOR for vic_race")

plot_pie_race2 = dangrous_data %>%
  group_by(level,vic_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level_lm
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>%
  filter(type == 2)

plot_pie_race2 = plot_ly(data = plot_pie_race2, x = ~ vic_race, y= ~n_obs, type = "bar", color = ~vic_race) %>% 
  layout(title = "FELONY for vic_age")

plot_pie_race0
plot_pie_race1
plot_pie_race2

dangrous_data_3 = dangrous_data %>% 
  mutate(
   level_lm = case_when(
     level == 'VIOLATION' ~ 0,
     level == "MISDEMEANOR" ~ 0,
     level == "FELONY" ~ 1
   )
  )  %>% 
  mutate(
    level_lm = ordered(level_lm, labels = c('0', '1'))
    )
model_vicrace <- glm(level_lm ~ vic_race, family = binomial, data = dangrous_data_3)

summary(model_vicrace)
```

The relationship between victim race and case level. The black race occupies the majority of the victims, and as the severity of the case increases, the proportion of black victims decreases significantly, while the proportion of white Hispanic and ASIAN/PACIFIC ISLAND victims gradually increases. This can be confirmed by observing the size relationship of the logistic regression coefficient.

### Conclude the multi logistic regression model
```{r}
dangerous = dangrous_data %>%
  mutate(
   level_lm = case_when(
     level == 'VIOLATION' ~ 0,
     level == "MISDEMEANOR" ~ 0,
     level == "FELONY" ~ 1
   ) ) %>% 
  mutate(
    level_lm = ordered(level_lm, labels = c('1', '0')
    ))

model_toal <- glm(level_lm ~ vic_race + vic_age_group + vic_sex,family = binomial,data=dangerous)    

summary(model_toal)
dangerous = dangerous %>% 
  filter(!vic_age_group == "18-24")
model_toal <- glm(level_lm ~ vic_race + vic_age_group + vic_sex,family = binomial,data=dangerous)
summary(model_toal)
```

We finally presented the model in the form of multiple logistic regression, but it should be noted that the information of the victim alone cannot fit the data well, and the regression only shows the correlation between the danger level and the characteristics of the victim.


## Additional study

For future research, we can deeply analyze the relationship between the specific event content and the victim for each type of danger level.
At present, for the example of a misdemeanor, we can use a pie chart to observe its event composition.

### Event composition of misdemeanor
```{r}
pie_chart = dangrous_data %>% 
  filter(level == "MISDEMEANOR")

pie_chart = pie_chart %>% 
  group_by(offense) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(
    offense = as.character(offense)
  )

pie_chart = rbind(pie_chart,c("others",290))
pie_chart = pie_chart %>% 
  mutate(
    n = as.numeric(n)
    ) %>% 
  filter(n > 100)

# mid victim event as offense details
plot_ly(pie_chart,labels = ~ offense,values = ~n) %>% 
  add_pie %>% 
  layout(title = "Constituent Incidents of MISDEMEANOR")
```

### Difference between common events
```{r}
offense_data = dangrous_data %>% 
  filter(offense == "ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES"|
           offense == "OFF. AGNST PUB ORD SENSBLTY &"|  
           offense == "CRIMINAL MISCHIEF & RELATED OF"|
           offense ==	"PETIT LARCENY"|offense=="OFFENSES AGAINST PUBLIC ADMINI" | 
           offense ==	"SEX CRIMES") %>% 
  filter(level == "MISDEMEANOR")

dnd = offense_data %>% 
  group_by(offense,vic_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    type = level
  ) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = offense,y=n_obs,fill = vic_sex)
  ) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "MISDEMEANOR Incidents VS victim sex ",
    x = "dangerous level",
    y = "number of cases"
  )
dnd
```

By observing the important event composition of misdemeanors and the differences in the characteristics of different victims, we can study the relationship between victim characteristics and danger in more detail. For example, by observing the event of OFF, AGNSTPUB ORD SENSBLTY, we can see that it has a strong gender tendency.
