#### The tentative project title

-   Analysis of New York City Public Safety Complaints

#### The motivation for this project

-   People live in New York City often receive public safety warnings
    from institutes and mobile apps. Our team intends to dig deeper into
    the public safety data, since public safety problem is a serious
    concern for many residents in New York City. And we expect to offer
    detailed analysis and possible future insights concerning public
    safety.

#### The intended final products

-   The team plans to explore the public safety data, then conducts
    detailed data analysis from various perspectives, and generate
    future insights on the basis of the result. Our team intends to
    build a github-based website to display our data exploration stories
    including analysis process and results.

#### The anticipated data sources

-   The anticipated data source would be the public safety distribution
    datasets from the Internet, like the “NYPD Complaint Data Historic”
    dataset and the “NYPD Complaint Data Current (Year To Date)” dataset
    offered by NYC OpenData.

#### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

-   Our planned analyses include analyzing the public safety complaints’
    distribution on different levels like date, geographical locations
    and crime details, and conducting statistical computation
    analysis.  
-   The team is going to construct multiple visualizations of the
    distribution of different variables and further statistical
    computations.  
-   The coding challenges include: data tidying & cleaning, proper data
    visualization, statistical computation, and website construction.

#### The planned timeline

-   Nov 12 - 20: confirm the dataset, and conduct initial exploration of
    the dataset. Import, tidy and clean the dataset.  
-   Nov 20 - 28: make data visualization for different variables and
    conduct detailed visual analysis
-   Nov 28 - Dec 5: conduct statistical analysis, and draw conclusions
    based on data.  
-   Dec 5 - 9: review and revise the project, and implement more
    possible content.
