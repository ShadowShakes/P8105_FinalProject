<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Motivation: As international students who have just come to U.S. for
four months, personal safety is our most important and most concerned
issue. To be honest, New York City is not as safe as we thought. We can
get information about assaults or shoots from various sources.
Meanwhile, we also heard that the crime rate in New York has increased
significantly after Covid-19. Our project aims to investigate whether
the rumor is true and tries to find any pattern related to crimes in New
York City.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>Related work: One of our group members recently downloaded an app
called ‘Citizen’, which will alert you if there is any incident around
you. It also provides a map highlighting recent cases. This is where our
inspiration comes from. What’s more, we previously did Problem 2 in
Homework 5, which contains a dataset gathering homicide information in
50 large U.S. cities. That dataset also gives us inspiration about what
we can do with it. There is one more interesting thing. In the process
of doing the project, it reminds one group member of a drama named
‘Person of Interest’ he watched before. In each episode, the machine
gives out a social security number, and the person with the SSN will
experience a crime. The machine is doing a job of calculating everyone’s
risk of being involved in a crime, and we want to do that as well,
predicting a person’s risk based on his characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>Data: At first, we tried to reach out to Citizen App to see whether
they could share the dataset with us. Unfortunately, they refused such a
request. Then we searched for open dataset recording crimes in New York
City and got this final historic dataset. The raw dataset has 34
variables, and we want to select meaningful and valuable ones. We got
rid of redundant variables or the ones with little information to keep
the whole dataset and tidy. For data cleaning, we separated
<code>date</code> into <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, and
<code>day</code>, and separated time of the day into <code>hour</code>
and <code>min</code>. Besides, we found out that the data size for
<code>00:01:00</code> is disproportionately large compared to the other
time values. We assumed <code>00:01:00</code> is the default value for
<code>time</code>, so we set the <code>hour</code> and
<code>minute</code> of these rows to be <code>NA</code> values in order
not to yield results not reflecting the real situations. We then added
variables <code>day_of_week</code>, <code>hour</code>, and
<code>covid_state</code> for EDA and statistical tests. Finally, we set
all the unknown or incomprehensible values to be <code>NA</code> values.
Key variables that were used in our analyses include:</p>
<p><img src="Images/Report_Images/example_word_cloud.jpeg" style="width:40%"></p>
<ul>
<li><code>level</code>: level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, and
violation</li>
<li><code>offense</code>: type of offense</li>
<li><code>susp_age_group</code>: suspect’s age group</li>
<li><code>susp_race</code>: suspect’s race</li>
<li><code>susp_sex</code>: suspect’s sex</li>
<li><code>vic_age_group</code>: victim’s age group</li>
<li><code>vic_race</code>: victim’s race</li>
<li><code>vic_sex</code>: victim’s sex</li>
<li><code>borough</code></li>
<li><code>longitude</code></li>
<li><code>latitude</code></li>
<li><code>year</code></li>
<li><code>month</code></li>
<li><code>day_of_week</code>: day of the week</li>
<li><code>hour</code></li>
<li><code>covid_state</code>: before vs during the COVID-19
pandemic</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data-driven Analysis</h2>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial questions</h3>
<p>First, we hope to find the relationship between crime level, places,
time and other things with the suspect information. There are some
variables that can reflect the suspects’ information:
<code>susp_age_group</code>, <code>susp_sex</code> and
<code>susp_race</code>. <code>Susp_age_group</code> means the age
distribution of suspects. According to the age of the suspects, we
divided them into five groups. <code>Susp_sex</code> means the gender of
suspect. <code>Susp_race</code> means the race of suspect. There are
totally six kinds of race, and we are most interested in the differences
between the yellow race which is Asian and other races.</p>
<p>Then, we wish to study the relationship between crime incidents and
victim attributes. By observing the data, we found that the variables
that can reflect the attributes of the victim are:
<code>vic_race</code>, <code>vic_age</code>, <code>vic_sex</code>, which
respectively represent the race, age and sex of the victim. Criminal
events are defined as violations, misdemeanors, and felonies. We will
discuss this issue by observing whether the severity of the case is
related to the victim’s race, age range, and gender.</p>
<p>After that, we are trying to dig out the relationship between cases
and regions. The first thing is to define how to evaluate cases. We now
have the total number of complaints recorded from 2016 to 2022, but does
the dataset truly record all the cases? We think this question can be
raised to every dataset, and even though it is not completely recorded,
it represents a perfect sample of the population. Initially, we would
like to get the probability that the crime will happen. Then we realized
that it was impossible because we only have the recorded cases, and we
don’t have safe situations. That might be a publication bias, and we
could not get the crime rate based on this dataset. Hence, we later
focus on the number of cases monthly and the felony rate. We care much
about felony because it has the greatest impact on our personal safety.
I did the job to figure out the difference in monthly cases and felony
rates between the five boroughs in New York City. We wanted to see which
borough is the safest and which one is the most dangerous. Then I
realized that using the borough variable may be a bit too broad. There
is another variable called precinct which divides New York City into
smaller areas. However, that is not a good idea to use in the comparison
part because there are so many precincts. It can be used in the
prediction part. We may also want to ask what is the trend of felony
frequency in NYC over time? Are there any temporal patterns of felony
frequency, particularly robbery? Are there any seasonal differences? We
want to explore patterns in felony frequency in NYC regarding date and
time. The focus is on identifying trends related to the month, day of
the week, and hour of the day. The period of interest is from 2016 to
September 2022, with a specific focus on changes before and during the
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploratory analysis</h3>
<p>We will first use data visualization to give an overview of the
distribution of suspect’s features. We draw plots according to suspect’s
sex, race, and age group.</p>
<p>For the second part, we draw hierarchical histograms to observe the
difference in the number of different types of cases under the
circumstances of different victims’ gender, age and race. Since the
bases of each type of occurrence time are different, the pie chart
method is used to further compare the proportion of cases of different
genders, youths, and races.</p>
<p>For the third part, we made plots to show the frequency of felonies
by borough and the proportion of felonies by borough and year. We would
like to see if there is any pattern that can be seen at first glance.
Moreover, we also made an interactive plot using <code>ploy_ly</code>
like the one discussed in class to show the borough, precinct, level,
and offense on a map according to latitude and longitude. Since the
dataset is too big, it’s hard to put all the data on one interactive
map. Thus, we only do that using data in 2022.</p>
<p>At last, we create two plots showing the hourly frequency of felonies
and robberies by hour of the day and day of the week.</p>
Relevant plots are shown below:

<div id="additional-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Additional Analysis</h3>
<p>We use statistical tests to find if there is a difference in daily
crime records of suspects from difference races. And according to the
test results, we can find that there’s a significant difference between
the suspect races. We also performed a logistic regression between
felony and non-felony case types and different victim characteristics to
see what have a significant impact on the distribution of case types.
The regression coefficients are all significant, indicating that the
victim’s age, gender and race information have a significant impact on
the case level. What’s more, the difference in coefficient value
reflects the impact of different categories of people on the case level
from weak to strong. For example, <code>vic_race</code>=ASIAN/PACIFIC
ISLANDER and their impact on whether the case type is finally judged as
a felony is 0.406, which is significantly higher than that of
<code>vic_race</code>=BLACK, which is in line with our previous
analysis, that is, although the proportion of victims of the black
family is relatively large, as the case level However, the degree of
change in the types of victims is more significant in ASIAN/PACIFIC
ISLANDER. For the borough analysis, we performed some statistical tests
to find if there is a difference in crime records from different
boroughs. We used ANOVA table to analyze the differences in monthly
cases and felony rates. And in the time analysis part, we also use
one-way ANOVA to test if the daily frequency of felonies is the same
across the four seasons in pre-COVID years.</p>

<h2>Shiny Apps</h2>
<p>In order to make our investigation more detailed and vivid, we
construct several Shiny Apps for user interaction. The first and the
second are Shiny interactive maps based on data before and after covid.
The third is a potential danger assessment for people who want to go
out. We also develop a map for CUMC campus region, which would be
included in CUMC safety analysis section.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion:</h2>
<p>From the proportion of suspect sex and year, we can see that Men
account for most crimes. However, after 2020, that is, after the
outbreak of the epidemic, the proportion of male group crimes has
decreased. We guess it may be because the epidemic has a greater
psychological and physical impact on women. In the angle of crime level,
the men have the largest part in felony, while in the proportion of
misdemeanors and violation, the part of men has decreased. Especially in
the crime of violation, women account for more than a quarter. In the
proportion of suspect race and year, the Black take the largest part of
crime, second is white Hispanic, then white, the last are black Hispanic
and Asian. The race proportion of suspects does not change with time. In
the crime level of felony, black take larger part than misdemeanors and
violation. The White are more likely to commit misdemeanors and
violation, rather than felony. When refers to suspect age group, we
found that people between 25 and 44 years old take the largest part of
crime. This proportion is even increasing every year. We also did the
regression of the suspect’s gender and race on other variables
respectively. We find that the coefficient of each variable is
significant. We also found men prefer to commit crimes in borough STATEN
ISLAND. They are more likely to commit crimes against age groups of
45-64 years old, sex of female and race of black.</p>
<p>The gender ratio of victims at different levels is discovered. In the
violation category, the ratio of male victims to females is: 35.6%:
64.4%. misdemeanor category: 47.6%: 52.4%, felony category: 47.7%: 52.3.
From the results, it can be simply analyzed that when the crime type is
violence, which is relatively mild, the probability of the victim being
a female is significantly higher than that of a male. And when the
severity of the crime type rises to misdemeanor and felony, the
probability of the victim being male and female tends to be similar, and
the probability of male is slightly lower than that of female. In the
same way, we want to observe the differences in different age ranges and
levels. The results show that although the victim group is mainly
targeted at 25-44. In the progression of violations to misdemeanors and
felonies, the 45-64 victim age group dropped about 4 percentage points
and the 18-24 victim age group rose about 3 points. The same method
observes the relationship between victim race and case level. The black
race occupies most of the victims, and as the severity of the case
increases, the proportion of black victims decreases significantly,
while the proportion of white Hispanic and ASIAN/PACIFIC ISLAND victims
gradually increases.</p>
<p>We found that Brooklyn had the most felonies, followed by Manhattan,
and Bronx has about the same felonies as Queens. Staten Island has the
least felonies. The proportion of felonies does not appear to have
changed significantly over the years. The five boroughs do not have
equal monthly cases, and the pairwise t-test further reveals each
borough differs from the others on monthly cases. Based on monthly
cases, from highest to lowest, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx, Queens,
Staten Island. Further, the five boroughs do not have equal felony
rates, and the pairwise t-test further reveals that Bronx and Staten
Island are different from others; Manhattan differs from Brooklyn, but
does not differ from Queens; while Brooklyn does not differ from Queens
either. Based on felony rate, from highest to lowest, Brooklyn, Queens,
Manhattan, Bronx, Staten Island. This was somehow out of our
expectations because we often heard that Bronx is the most dangerous
borough. At least we could conclude that Staten Island is the safest
among the five boroughs. As for the most dangerous part, I think we can
investigate further on precincts, for example, East Harlem versus
Washington Heights because still, analysis based on the borough is just
too broad.</p>
<p>The felony frequency tended to be lower in colder months and higher
in warmer months before 2020. During the pandemic, the felony frequency
was at its lowest point in April 2020, probably due to the stay-at-home
order. The frequency in 2022 significantly increases compared to
previous years, reaching its highest point in June and July. Further
statistical analysis revealed that Felony frequencies vary across
seasons in pre-COVID years. The felony frequency is highest in the
afternoon and early evening, and lowest in the early morning. On
weekends, the frequency is higher in the late night compared to
weekdays. The frequency of robbery is like that of felony overall, but
robbery tends to be more common during the late-night hours on
weekends.</p>
