In this section we would like to explore more about the crime suspect's features. We mainly focus on studying the "Felony Crimes", which includes:  
"BURGLARY", "FELONY ASSAULT", "GRAND LARCENY", "GRAND LARCENY OF MOTOR VEHICLE", "MURDER & NON-NEGL. MANSLAUGHTER", "RAPE", "ROBBERY" in `offense` column

## Visual Analysis
We will first use data visualization to give an overview of the distribution of suspect's features.

```{r read&tidy, include = FALSE}
complaint =
  tibble(
    files = list.files("./Data/"),
    path = str_c("./Data/", files)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  select(-files, -path, -cmplnt_num, -ky_cd, -atpt_cptd, -jurisdiction, -jurisdiction_code) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = strftime(as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"),"%a")) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[month],
    hour = substr(time, start = 1, stop = 2),
    minute = substr(time, start = 4, stop = 5),
    borough = ifelse(borough == "(null)", NA, borough),
    susp_sex = ifelse(susp_sex %in% c("M", "F"), susp_sex, NA),
    susp_age_group = ifelse(susp_age_group %in% c("<18", "18-24", "25-44", "45-64", "65+"), susp_age_group, NA),
    susp_race = ifelse(susp_race %in% c("UNKNOWN", "(null)"), NA, susp_race),
    vic_sex = ifelse(vic_sex %in% c("M", "F"), vic_sex, NA),
    vic_age_group = ifelse(vic_age_group %in% c("<18", "18-24", "25-44", "45-64", "65+"), vic_age_group, NA),
    vic_race = ifelse(vic_race %in% c("UNKNOWN", "(null)"), NA, vic_race),
    offense = ifelse(offense %in% c("BURGLARY", "FELONY ASSAULT", "GRAND LARCENY", "GRAND LARCENY OF MOTOR VEHICLE", "MURDER & NON-NEGL. MANSLAUGHTER", "RAPE", "ROBBERY"), offense, NA)
  ) %>% 
  select(-day, -time) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.factor(year),
    month = factor(month, levels = month.abb),
    day_of_week = factor(day_of_week, levels = c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")),
    hour = factor(hour),
    precinct = as.factor(precinct),
    borough = as.factor(borough),
    level = as.factor(level),
    offense = as.factor(offense),
    susp_sex = as.factor(susp_sex),
    susp_age_group = as.factor(susp_age_group),
    susp_race = as.factor(susp_race),
    vic_sex = as.factor(vic_sex),
    vic_age_group = as.factor(vic_age_group),
    vic_race = as.factor(vic_race),
  )
```


### Suspect Sex

```{r plot_suspect_sex}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_sex) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_sex) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_sex, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Felonies by Suspect Sex and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Sex"
  )
```
According to the plot, most of the suspect's sex(if recorded) is male, female suspects appear to be much fewer than male suspect.  
And in 2020, the propotions of male suspect are even larger than other years.

### Suspect Race

```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_race) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_race) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_race, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Felonies by Suspect Race and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Race"
  )
```
Based on barplot, we can see that the most frequent suspect races are: Black, White Hispanic and White, while Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaskan Native are the least freqeut races to be a suspect.

### Suspect Age Group
```{r}
complaint %>% 
  drop_na(offense, susp_age_group) %>% 
  group_by(year, susp_age_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(susp_age_group, percentage = n_obs / sum(n_obs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = susp_age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion",
    title = "Proportions of Felonies by Suspect Age Group and Year",
    fill = "Suspect Age Group"
  )
```
According to the barplot, we can see that the age group between 25 and 44 years old takes up largest proportion in suspects, and the next is 18-24 years old.  
Besides, with time going by, the proportion of age group between 25-64 years old are rising in suspects' age distribution.


## Statistical Testing
We use statistical tests to find if there is a difference in daily crime records of suspects from difference races.

### Suspect Race
```{r}
crimebyday_aspa = complaint %>% 
  group_by(year,month,day_of_week) %>% 
  filter(susp_race == "ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER") %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_bydate = n(),
  ) %>% 
  unique()

crimebyday_white = complaint %>% 
  group_by(year,month,day_of_week) %>% 
  filter(susp_race == "WHITE") %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n_bydate = n(),
  ) %>% 
  unique()

t.test(crimebyday_aspa$n_bydate,crimebyday_white$n_bydate)
```

According to the test results, we can find that there's a significant difference between the suspect races.


## Regression Modelling Analysis
We try to build models to give prediction of the criminal's features based on other factors, and see if we can draw conclusions from the coefficients of the factors.

### Suspect Sex
```{r}
a <- list.files("./Data")     
dir <- paste("./Data/",a,sep = "")                  
n <- length(dir) 
merge_data <- read.csv(file = dir[1],header = T,sep =",")   
merge_data <- cbind(dir[1], merge_data )
merge_data <- rename(merge_data, c("dir[1]" = "yyyymm"))
for (i in 2:7){
  new.data <- read.csv(file = dir[i], header = T, sep = ",")
  new.data <- cbind(dir[i], new.data)
  new.data <- rename(new.data, c("dir[i]"="yyyymm"))
  merge_data <- rbind(merge_data,new.data)
}
```

```{r}
# filter data with unknown
tidydata1 = merge_data %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  filter(!susp_sex == "U") %>%
  filter(!susp_race == "UNKNOWN") %>%
  filter(!susp_age_group == "UNKNOWN") %>%
   filter(!vic_race == "UNKNOWN") %>%
  filter(!vic_age_group == "UNKNOWN") %>%
  separate(date,into = c("mon","day","year"),sep = "/") %>%
  mutate(jurisdiction_code = as.numeric(jurisdiction_code)) %>%
  mutate(susp_sex = ifelse(susp_sex == "M",1,0),vic_sex = ifelse(vic_sex == "M",1,0),jurisdiction_code=ifelse(jurisdiction_code >= 3,3,jurisdiction_code + 0)) %>%
  mutate(jurisdiction_code=as.factor(jurisdiction_code)) %>%
  mutate(covid_state=ifelse(year>=2020,1,0))
# When year >=2020, we assume the world is in a covid state.
```

We build a logistic regression model to predict the suspect's sex based on other factors.
```{r}
mylogit <- glm(susp_sex ~ precinct
               + borough + jurisdiction_code+atpt_cptd 
               +level+susp_age_group +susp_race+vic_age_group
               +vic_race+vic_sex+covid_state, data = tidydata1, family = "binomial")

mylogit %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value)
```

For backward stepwise, in order to select variables.

```{r}
step(mylogit, direction = 'backward')
```

Through backward, we found that we need all the variables.

We see the output of the model.
```{r}
tidydata1 %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(mylogit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = susp_age_group, y = resid)) + geom_violin() + facet_wrap(~covid_state)
```
